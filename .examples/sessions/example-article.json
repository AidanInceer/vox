  "extracted_text": "Welcome to vox! This is an example article that demonstrates how to use the session management features. vox allows you to save your reading progress and resume later from exactly where you left off. You can save sessions with custom names, list all your saved sessions, and even delete sessions you no longer need. The interactive playback controls let you pause, resume, and navigate through the audio using simple keyboard shortcuts. Press SPACE to pause or resume playback, use the arrow keys to skip forward or backward, and press Q to quit gracefully. For longer articles, vox uses intelligent chunking to provide faster feedback - you'll hear the first chunk of audio within 3 seconds while the rest synthesizes in the background.",
